# Python-Algorithms-Linked-List-Stack-and-Resistance
This repo contains Python scripts for three problems: 1) A singly linked list with basic operations, 2) Sorting a stack using a temporary stack, and 3) Calculating equivalent resistance between two nodes in a resistor network using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
